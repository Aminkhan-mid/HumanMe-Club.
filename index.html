        <p class="pitchTwo">You are probably experiencing Weirdmageddon, not a SHININGS, as Shinings are very rare. SHININGS are individuals who are 1,000 years old, while those experiencing Weirdmageddon are humans filled with a lot of weird energy. They may transform into a SHININGS and live up to 1,000 years.  Someone in your family was a SHININGS and has since died, and the ghosts of their past are haunting you, compelling you to become a SHININGS yourself.</p>

            <p class="para">We are the HumanMe Club where we only allow Humans who are weird and ancient like 1,000 Years Old. In this club, only The Weridest Survive; we take great pride in producing great humans who were weird but great, like Changiz Khan. We hold Extravagant parties in which alot of weirdness goes around, from which you have to figure out what other people's weird power are and KILL THEM before THEY KILL YOU, Hope you Enjoy Your Stay at the SHININGS.</p>
